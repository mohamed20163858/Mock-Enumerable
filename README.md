# Mock-Enumerable
> - Create a class MyList that has an instance variable @list.
  - In MyList implement a method #each that yields successive members of @list and uses the MyEnumerable module.
  - Create a module MyEnumerable that implements the following methods (they should have the same functionality as methods in [Enumerable](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/Enumerable.html)):
      - #all?
      - #any?
      - #filter
   - Each class and module should has a separate .rb file.
